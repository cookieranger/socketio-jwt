# Auth0 + Socket.io

This is the seed project you need to use if you're going to create a Socket.io single page app that will use Auth0.

## Running the example

First, you need to put your `AUTH0_DOMAIN` (example.auth0.com), your `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` and your `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` on the  `auth0-variables.js` file . You can find this information in the Application Settings on your Auth0.com dashboard.

In order to run the example, you need to have `node` installed. 

1. run `npm install` 
1. run `node index.js` in the directory of this project.


Go to [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) and you'll see the app running :).
